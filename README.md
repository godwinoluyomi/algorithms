SUM OF DISTINCT FILE in sum_distinct.algo
Step 1: Function to create an array from user input return the array.
Step 2: Function to check distinct of each of the array1 and array2.
Step 3: Sum the array distinct elements of array1 and array2.


VECTOR DOT PRODUCT in vector_dot_product.algo
Dot product is sum of all products of two corresponding array elements
1. Declare variables
2. Check if the two vectors are equal.
3. Multiply elements at the same position in both vector arrays
4. Sum the products of each position


ORTHOGONAL VECTORS in vector_dot_product.algo
Orthogonal vectors are perpendicular vectors ie. dot product = 0
1. Loop through each elements of each array.
2. Find the dot product
3. If dot product = 0 then the vectors (array) are orthogonal
