# algorithms
# This project helps to understand and demonstrate algorithms.
# The pseudocode for execution is as follows

    1. Check each character in the sentence that is not point (Used point to exit the loop)
    2. For each of those character also count an index to identify the character
    3. Select each character to determine if it is a space " "
        Generally, for every space there must be space + 1 words (For 2 spaces there is 3 words)
        Therefore words = space + 1
    4. Check if character is a vowel by comparing with a or e or i or o or u
    5. Sum the point back to the sentence
